	One of the intended demographic groups that Transit Smart is aimed at is the young adult group (18 - 25 yrs). <br> <br>
		There is an immense potential in this demographic, as this is the prime age for travelling &#8212; concerts, parties, musuems, restaurants, etc. 
		<br> <br>
		
	The language of the interface and system has been kept quirky to appeal to this group.

	It is a frustrating process, to get used to how the buses work, to navigate through the workings of it, transferring, bus schedules.  <br> <br> There is no Wi-fi access at home, and definitely no Wi-Fi access at bus stops. <br> <br> Also, not all bus stops are located conveniently for everyone, it can be a 1 minute walk or a 15 minute one.
		<br> <br>
		
		The inteface aims to overall contribute to the betterment of navigating through the bus system, but also act as a point of contact &#8212; new updates, bus stop closures, bus delays, it is all present there.
