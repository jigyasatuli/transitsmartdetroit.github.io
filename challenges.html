	<div class="c-1">
	<h3>
	Simplifying the already exisiting bus systems for the public.
	</h3>	
	
	<p>
	The biggest challenge was to simplify the route map system. 
There are multiple bus routes, and multiple bus lines running on similar routes, which creates challenges in categorizing.

	<div class="c-2">
	<h3>
	Combining the two bus systems into one interface.	
		
	</h3>
		
	<p>
	There are namely two bus systems running the span of Detroit, DDOT and SMART.
		
	<br> Both of these systems are managed by separate departments and thus operate differently, having a different set of rules, categories, policies etc. There is a clear lack of an efficient bridge between  the two.

	<div class="c-3">
	<h3>
	Improving ease of use and access to already existing users.
		
	
	</h3>
		<p>
	More than 50% of the population in Detroit falls under the low income group &#8212; which form the primary users of the buses.
And about 49% of the households in Detroit do not have access to Wi-Fi. 
		Thus, creating an app or a website was not the answer to provide information.
		Plus, there are already apps and websites by both DDOT and SMART.

		<div class="c-4">
	<h3>
	Increasing bus transit footfall by tapping into 
		a potential demographic.
	</h3>	
	<p>
	The untapped demographic becomes the youth without cars, out-of-state students, international students, etc.
	During various discussions and from personal experience, the reason why buses become out of question is the complexity of its use, unavailability of such information.

	<h3>
	Addressing inclusive design challenges.
	</h3>	
	<p>
	Designing for everyone.
	Special focus on one of the most commonly overlooked issues in transit systems: color-blindness.
