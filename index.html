			What problems is Transit Smart addressing?
			
			</p>	
			
			
		<!-- <p> 
		&#8594; A huge population of Detroit falls under the low income group, which depends on public transportation for their daily commute. Transferd between the different bus systems is difficult and confusing. <br> <br> 
			
		&#8594; The younger population demographic is very apprehensive about using buses for travel because of no awareness about its working and lack of accessibilty to information. <br> <br>
			
		&#8594; About 45% of Detroit does not have Wi-Fi connections. This makes the already exisiting apps and websites by the bus companies redundant for all these people. <br> <br>
